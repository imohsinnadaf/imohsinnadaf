### If you want, I can:
- Convert this into a more visual README (with badges, icons and a project gallery).
- Create a set of example project entries (I’ll draft `README`s for 2–3 projects and a short portfolio layout).
- Generate a small GitHub Actions workflow to auto-update a README stats section.

Thanks — tell me which of the optional follow-ups you want next (visual/markdown badges, project entries, or actions), and I’ll add them directly into the README for you.
